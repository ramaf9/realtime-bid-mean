Achieve all requirement functional and non-functional
Bonus achieved :
 - Material design for UI
 - tested in Mocha framework

 Technology used :
 - XAMPP 5.5.37
 - npm/node 2.15
 - Mysql DB 10.1.13-MariaDB

 Getting started :
 1. Download & install all technology used (recommended: use same version as me)
 2. Run mysql server/xampp ,then Extract sourcecode, then open terminal
 4. Go to extracted folder, import database "crossover-auction.sql" to mysql server then start "node server.js" in terminal
optional: check for node_modules
 5. check for database configuration at connection.js (suit yours)
 6. Server will running on default port 8080, you can change if you want (see terminal log)
 7. Open crossover-js/public/app.js, see constant "restUrl", change to your node server url
 8. Start web server XAMPP or open public folder then type "php -S localhost:8000" on terminal
Hint: public folder need to be root url, example : "http://localhost:8000/"

 Run unit test :
 1. Step 1 - 6 must be completed
 2. Change url in test/auction.js suit yours
 3. in terminal type npm test

Issues that i have faced:
 1. No one to ask, only my best friend google.com
 2. Taking longer than 10 hours
 3. Still got some little bug
 4. I cant do unit test for update and post, so i do it with checking from firefox developer mode

 Feedback:
 1. It is already good, maybe if get two or more assignment so we can pick it up
